## Icons

Cyberpunk-Neon doesn't provide a custom icon pack, so the following is a list of icon packs that fits this theme without any connection with Cyberpunk-Neon (except Suru++).

### Suru++

Suru++ includes a Cyberpunk-Neon variant. You can use [Suru++ icons](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus) (papirus-like) or [Suru++ AsprÃ³mauros](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus-aspromauros) (monochrome, gradient if wished). Refer to the [Suru++ Wiki](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/wiki) for more info.

### Papirus Kolorizer

Alternatively you can use the papirus-kolorizer.sh script included in this repository **WARNING**: It will replace your existing Papirus icons, if any. Refer to [Papirus Kolorizer repo](https://github.com/DarthWound/papirus-kolorizer) for more info.

```
chmod +x papirus-kolorizer.sh
./papirus-kolorizer.sh
```

Apply the icons (Papirus-Dark) in system settings (KDE = Settings -> Appearance- Icons. Apply icons for GTK applications too in Settings -> Appearance - Application Style).

### Linebit

Icons at the left of the screenshots are extracted from [Linebit Android Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edzondm.linebit) and then customized one-by-one via KDE Plasma "Edit applications".

### Candy

Another fiting icons pack may be [Candy icons](https://store.kde.org/p/1305251/).
